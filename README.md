# Dataset Mirroring
This repository is for tracking progress on climate dataset mirroring. It uses this site's "issues" tracker to keep track of progress on mirroring climate datasets. Each dataset will have its own issue for discussion of mirroring, as well as location of mirrors and who is doing the work.

## Contributing a New Dataset
To start, search the issues in this repository for keywords related to your dataset to see if it is already being handled. If there is not an open issue for the dataset already, create a new issue for it and include the following:
 1. In the title, include the dataset name
 2. In the body, include any descriptive information necessary to make a mirror of the dataset. At a minimum, include the web URL for the dataset descriptions (home page) as well as any hosted versions of the dataset on FTP or HTTP that can be downloaded.
 3. Optionally, include the size of the dataset, if known, and the responsible agency.
 4. If you have already created a mirror of this dataset, or know of an existing mirror, then please include the URLs of those mirrors in the issue description.
 5. If you are working on mirroring the data, assign the issue to yourself. If not, leave it blank.
 6. Depending on how many mirrors you provided in the links, assign the label "No Mirrors", "One Mirror" or "Two or More Mirrors" to the issue to help people filter by datasets that need mirroring.

## New Dataset Submission Template
If you'd like, you can use the below as a simplified template for your submission:

 * _Dataset Homepage:_
 * _Dataset Bulk Download Link (if available):_
 * _Mirror URLs:_
 * _Mirrored By:_
 * _Size:_
 * _Responsible Agency:_

That's it! If you have other questions, see http://climatemirror.org
