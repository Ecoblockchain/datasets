# Labeling Format for Datasets/Issues
This has been the approach so far when labeling.

## Status Labels
*Reasoning*: Status labels are designed to help mirror owners determine which labels need mirroring. In general, the long-term goal
would be to have more than one mirror of each of these datasets, and the status labels indicate how many mirrors exist. In this category, we have the following labels:

 * Status: No Mirrors: We do not know of any available mirrors for this data
 * Status: Offline Mirror: We have reports of an offline mirror for this data, but no URL exists for accessing it. This is its own label because it's less reliable than an online mirror in that it can't be verified.
 * Status: One Mirror: We know of at least one online mirror with a URL.
 * Status: Two or More Mirrors: We know of at least two online mirrors with URLs.
 
Ideally, marking any of the status labels except _Status: No Mirrors_ is accompanied by a link or other documentation about where that mirror is located.
